# pyrflink
Python to decode the data from RFlink gateway see http://www.nemcon.nl/blog2/

The idea of this script is to get data and decode it to enable sending the data to Home-Assistant (https://home-assistant.io)

** Currently it only contains a test script to get the data from RFlink from http://www.nemcon.nl/blog2/ **

Once I've got the script working correctly I will figure out the home-assistant bits.
